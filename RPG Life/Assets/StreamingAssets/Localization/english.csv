crystalsInTheForgottenMineTitle,"Crystals in the Forgotten Mine"
crystalsInTheForgottenMineDescription,"The Fire Guild senses raw magic beneath the forgotten tunnels.<br>Enter the mine and collect 3 Lizard Crystals."
crystalsInTheForgottenMineSuccess,"You descend carefully into the mine, your staff illuminating the damp stone walls.<br>Faint blue light flickers between cracks in the rock — raw mana crystallized by time and pressure.<br>A few cave critters scatter as you collect the glowing shards.<br>By the time you emerge, your pouch hums softly with arcane energy.<br>The Guild will be pleased."
crystalsInTheForgottenMineFailure,"Deeper in the tunnels, the air grows heavy and unstable. A sudden tremor shakes loose stones from above, forcing you to retreat before the passage collapses.<br>You leave empty-handed, your robes covered in dust — but at least you learned which paths are unsafe.<br>Next time, you’ll be better prepared."

collapsedTunnelInvestigationTitle,"The Collapsed Tunnel"
collapsedTunnelInvestigationDescription,"The lower chambers of the mine have partially collapsed after your last visit.<br>The Guild believes the arcane pulse comes from beyond the sealed passage."
collapsedTunnelInvestigationSuccess,"You return to the mine with greater caution, the memory of falling stones still fresh in your mind.<br>With controlled bursts of <b>focused magic</b>, you carefully clear unstable debris without triggering another collapse.<br>Beyond the rubble, a faint crystal formation glows brighter than the others — pulsing like a heartbeat.<br>You collect fragments for the Guild and mark the deeper path for further study.<br>The source of the disturbance lies further below."
collapsedTunnelInvestigationFailure,"As you attempt to clear the blocked passage, the weakened ceiling groans ominously.<br>A surge of unstable mana erupts from the fractured crystals, forcing you to shield yourself and retreat.<br>The tunnel remains sealed, and whatever lies beyond continues to pulse in the darkness.<br>You will need steadier control — and stronger magic — to proceed."

crystalHeartGuardianTitle,"The Crystalheart Guardian"
crystalHeartGuardianDescription,"Deep beneath the mine, the arcane pulse takes form.<br>A corrupted elemental guards the growing Crystalheart."
crystalHeartGuardianSuccess,"The air thickens as you descend into the lowest chamber.<br>At its center floats a jagged mass of crystal and stone — a <b>Crystalheart Guardian</b>, born from unstable mana.<br>It lashes out in shards of glowing fragments, but your spells strike true.<br>With a final surge of focused power, the construct fractures and collapses into harmless crystal dust.<br>The chamber grows silent. The pulse weakens — but it is not yet gone."
crystalHeartGuardianFailure,"The Crystalheart Guardian awakens fully as you enter the chamber.<br>Shards of crystal orbit its core, slicing through the air with violent precision.<br>Your spells falter against its unstable shell, and a blast of raw mana forces you back toward the tunnels.<br>You barely escape as the chamber trembles behind you.<br>The Guardian remains — stronger than expected."

sealTheArcaneCoreTitle,"Seal the Arcane Core"
sealTheArcaneCoreDescription,"With the Guardian destroyed, the true source of the disturbance is revealed.<br>Descend into the ley-line chamber and seal the unstable Arcane Core."
sealTheArcaneCoreSuccess,"Beyond the shattered remains of the Guardian lies a cavern unlike the others.<br>At its center floats a swirling sphere of raw, untamed mana — the <b>Arcane Core</b>.<br>The ley-line pulses violently, threatening to rupture the entire mine.<br>You steady your breath and channel every fragment of discipline you possess.<br>Runes ignite around the chamber as you weave a sealing pattern into the air.<br>The Core resists — then slowly contracts, its light softening to a steady glow.<br>The tremors cease. The mine is safe.<br>When you emerge beneath the open sky, you feel stronger — changed by the power you contained."
sealTheArcaneCoreFailure,"The Arcane Core surges the moment you approach it.<br>Raw mana lashes outward in chaotic waves, tearing at your focus.<br>You attempt to bind the energy, but the ley-line fractures under the strain.<br>The chamber erupts in blinding light, forcing you to retreat before the collapse consumes you.<br>The Core remains unstable, its pulse echoing through the depths.<br>This will require greater mastery — and perhaps a steadier mind."

marshWhispersTitle,"Echoes in the Marsh of Whispers"
marshWhispersDescription,"Strange lights flicker above the flooded ruins beyond the village marsh.<br>The Fire Guild asks you to investigate the disturbance and recover any surviving texts."
marshWhispersSuccess,"Mist coils around your boots as you step into the marshlands.<br>Between broken stone pillars, you find the remains of an ancient archive half-sunken in dark water.<br>A faint magical resonance leads you to a sealed chest preserved by old warding runes.<br>With careful hands, you recover a damp but intact <b>Arcane Journal</b> from within.<br>The lights fade as you leave, as if satisfied their message was heard."
marshWhispersFailure,"The marsh shifts beneath your steps, mud swallowing your footing.<br>A surge of cold, stagnant mana ripples through the flooded ruins, disrupting your focus.<br>You search briefly, but the unstable currents make it too dangerous to continue.<br>The lights flicker once more in the distance before vanishing into the mist."

sunkenSealTitle,"The Sealed Floodgate"
sunkenSealDescription,"The recovered Arcane Journal speaks of a hidden chamber beneath the flooded ruins.<br>Use its notes to locate and unseal the ancient floodgate."
sunkenSealSuccess,"Following the journal’s faded diagrams, you wade deeper into the submerged archive.<br>Behind a curtain of hanging roots, you uncover a circular stone mechanism etched with old warding glyphs.<br>You press your palm against the runes and channel a steady flow of mana, aligning the pattern described in the <b>Arcane Journal</b>.<br>The floodgate trembles before slowly grinding open, revealing a hidden vault untouched by time.<br>Inside, resting upon a pedestal, you find an ornate <b>Silver Key</b> — still humming with protective magic."
sunkenSealFailure,"You attempt to replicate the sealing pattern described in the journal, but the runes resist your control.<br>The marsh water surges violently as unstable magic reacts to your interference.<br>A sharp pulse of energy forces you back, and the glyphs dim once more.<br>The floodgate remains sealed, its secrets protected for now."

drownedArchivistTitle,"The Drowned Archivist"
drownedArchivistDescription,"Beyond the opened floodgate lies a submerged vault untouched for centuries.<br>Use the Silver Key to enter and confront what guards the forbidden knowledge."
drownedArchivistSuccess,"The <b>Silver Key</b> turns with a heavy click, and the vault door slowly parts, releasing a breath of cold, stagnant air.<br>Inside, shelves of preserved tomes float in suspended water, held aloft by ancient magic.<br>At the chamber’s center rises a translucent figure — the <b>Drowned Archivist</b>, bound to protect the knowledge within.<br>You weave counter-spells through the waterlogged air, unraveling the spirit’s bindings without destroying it entirely.<br>With a final surge of focused mana, the entity dissipates into harmless mist, leaving behind a pulsating <b>Waterbound Sigil</b>.<br>The archive is now open — but its core still trembles below."
drownedArchivistFailure,"As the vault opens, the chamber floods with spectral light.<br>The <b>Drowned Archivist</b> awakens in full, its voice echoing like distant bells beneath water.<br>Your spells distort in the dense, saturated air, and the spirit’s energy surges outward in a crushing wave.<br>You stagger back through the doorway as the vault seals itself once more.<br>The guardian remains vigilant, its duty not yet fulfilled."

drownedCoreTitle,"Bind the Drowned Core"
drownedCoreDescription,"With the Waterbound Sigil in your possession, the final chamber beneath the archive reveals itself.<br>Descend into the abyss and bind the unstable Drowned Core before it consumes the marsh."
drownedCoreSuccess,"The depths beneath the archive open into a vast submerged cavern, illuminated by a spiraling vortex of blue-white energy.<br>At its center churns the <b>Drowned Core</b>, a fusion of ley-line currents and ancient preservation magic gone awry.<br>You raise the <b>Waterbound Sigil</b>, and its markings ignite in radiant light.<br>Channeling every ounce of discipline, you anchor the sigil’s pattern into the swirling heart of the vortex.<br>The waters roar and crash against invisible barriers, but your will holds steady.<br>Slowly, the violent currents soften, condensing into a stable, luminous sphere.<br>The marsh grows quiet. The ruins no longer whisper in unrest.<br>You leave the depths carrying the calm of a mage who has mastered chaos."
drownedCoreFailure,"The cavern trembles as the <b>Drowned Core</b> senses your presence.<br>You invoke the <b>Waterbound Sigil</b>, but the vortex surges violently, overwhelming the binding pattern.<br>Water and raw mana spiral together in a deafening maelstrom, shattering your focus.<br>With the chamber collapsing around you, you are forced to retreat before the energy consumes everything.<br>The Core remains unstable, its restless pulse echoing through the marshlands."
